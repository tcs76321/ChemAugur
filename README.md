# ChemAugur
An open source project aiming to use graph neural networks to predict the physical properties of chemicals based only on their molecular structure and atomic makeup.

Other projects have completed similar functionalities so this is largely a mere exercise in OSS, machine learning and software engineering and does not aim to be a ground breaking advancement.

*Early Development*

This project is still in the initial design phases and is not quite ready to be presented. Once a solid basis for ChemAugur has been completed by the initial team it will be made public here.

Road Map:

- Early Design and Testing: The core technologies will be finalized and limited functionallity for basic molecules obtained. The primary goal here will be to attain reasonable results for fundamental chemicals such as water and methane at room temperature and pressue.
- Public Release and Opening For Contributions: Once this has been completed the next phasae will be to gain public feedback and critiques on implementations, techniques and results.
- Refinement: This phase will focus on expanding training data sets, improved fine tuning, and the widening of input parameters. This will depend largely on training data.
