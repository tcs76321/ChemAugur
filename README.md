# ChemAugur
An open source project aiming to use graph neural networks to predict the physical properties of chemicals based only on their molecular structure and atomic makeup..


*Early Development*
The this project is still in the initial design phases and is not quite ready to be presented. Once a solid basis for ChemAugur has been completed by the initial team it will be made public here.
