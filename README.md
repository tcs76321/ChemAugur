# ChemAugur

### An open source project aiming to use graph neural networks to predict the physical properties of chemicals based only on their molecular structure and atomic makeup.

## Research and Development Plan:
- ‚úÖ Fundamental Pytorch, Torch Geometric, RDKit architecture setup and verified
- ‚úÖ First dataset identified, PubChem Compound SDFs via FTP
- ‚úÖ Finished data script to download, hashcheck, and manage SDF files from PubChem
- ‚úÖ Recognized issues and limitations with using only a PubChem Compound SDF Datasource
- ‚ùå Identify possible superior data sources; some options, but no complete solutions
- üë®‚Äçüíª Architect and develop ETL pipeline and a data warehouse to begin building up
  - Multi-faceted approach
    - Obtain valid and stereochemistry warning-free SMILES from PubChem SDFs, maybe to act as IDs for each entry, and then the basis for building molecular graphs with RDkit
    - Use aatbio bp and mp data-set to obtain boiling points, and possibly more compounds, revalidate with RDKit at each step
    - Focus on relevant chemicals with an inclusive variety of bonds and stereochemical features
- ‚òëÔ∏è Build up an adequate dataset in the warehouse to train on, at least thousands, likely need tens of thousands of molecules
- ‚òëÔ∏è Refine and expand training procedure, focusing on picking best properties
- ‚òëÔ∏è Train on the data warehouse
- ‚òëÔ∏è Experiment with properties other than normal boiling point
  - Toxicity
  - Psychotropic Effects
  - Receptor affinities
- ‚òëÔ∏è Repeat from: Build up a larger database, or refactor datawarehouse, or refactor pipeline
